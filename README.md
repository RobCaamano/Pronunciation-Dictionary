# Pronunciation-Dictionary
The program takes input of 'n' lines of the pronunciation dictionary of size 'k'.  

The input is a single positive integer n. If the largest set of homophones in the first n lines of the pronunciation dictionary is of size k, then your program should print out kon the fist line, followed by k homophones, each on a new line. If there is more than one collection of k homo-phones, your program should print out each group, separated by a blank line. The output should be all upper case for consistency with the pronunciation dictionary.
